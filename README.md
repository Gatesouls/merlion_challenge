Entrance point - transform_word.php (can be launched from Windows and Unix-like terminal)
# WordTransfomer
- transforms one word to another by changing 1 letter in word each time (the words actually exist and their spelling is correct) and displays the chain of transformation.
Utilizes Brute Force thus considered very inefficient (more elegant realisation has not visited my mind yet)
Requires GNU Aspell (http://aspell.net/) in order to work correctly
